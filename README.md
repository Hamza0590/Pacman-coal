# 🎮 Terminal Pacman

**Terminal Pacman** is a classic grid-based arcade game recreated in the terminal using **Assembly Language** with the **Irvine32** library. Designed as a university project, this solo-developed game showcases core programming concepts like control flow, logic, and memory handling in low-level language.

---

## 📌 Features

- Built using **MASM** and the **Irvine32** library.
- Fully playable in the terminal window.
- **3 uniquely designed levels**, each with increasing complexity and new grid patterns.
- Classic gameplay: 
  - Eat **pallets (.)**
  - Grab **bonuses (*)**
  - Gain powers by eating **power-ups (p)**
  - Avoid the **ghosts (G)** to survive!

## 🧠 Project Purpose

This project was developed as part of a university course to strengthen our understanding of **Assembly Language** and low-level system programming concepts. It reflects manual control of screen buffers, user input, and game logic—all within the constraints of assembly.

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- **MASM** (Microsoft Macro Assembler)
- **Irvine32 library** properly configured
- A Windows system with a terminal capable of running `.exe` files built with MASM

## 📂 How to Run

1. Make sure **MASM** is installed on your system.
2. Download the project folder: [`pacman.zip`](./pacman.zip)
3. Extract the folder.
4. Open the `.sln` file using a supported IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
5. Ensure that the **Irvine32 library path** is correctly set in your project settings.
6. Build and run the project.

> ✅ You must have the `Irvine32.inc`, `Irvine32.lib`, and supporting files accessible in your project path or system library path.
